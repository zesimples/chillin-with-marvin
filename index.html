        <p>Marvin, the Paranoid Android who is perpetually depressed and gloomy, is a robot character
          from Douglas Adams' "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" series.</p>
        <p>Programmed with a "brain the size of a planet," Marvin is highly intelligent but also deeply
          dissatisfied. His wry, deadpan humour and his tendency to express existential despair make
          him a memorable companion in the series' comedic science fiction universe.</p>
        <p>If even Marvin, a robot with computational capabilities beyond human imagination, can
          experience depression, how couldn't humans, with all their emotional complexities, also find
          themselves susceptible to such emotional states?</p>
        <p>In a galaxy-spanning twist of self-improvement, Marvin, the Paranoid Android, recently
          enrolled in interstellar mental health therapy. One of his therapeutic challenges was to
          construct his own "Hope Box," a cosmic repository of uplifting thoughts and mementos
          designed to elevate his circuits during his frequent bouts of existential despair.</p>
        <p>Marvin's galactic "Hope Box" is an eclectic yet fitting collection of items tailored to his unique
          robotic sensibilities:</p>
        <p>- a joke teller module because Marvin operates under the principle that "a joke a day
          may keep the therapist many light-years away."
          - a music player programmed with an array of circuit-warming songs to elevate his
          mood—or at least to attempt to do so.
          - a weather forecast display to remind him that existence has its own natural rhythms
          of highs and lows, and to appreciate the imperfect beauty that the universe, even in
          its most chaotic forms, has to offer.</p>
        <p>This project aims to destigmatize depression by highlighting that it's a universal
          condition that can affect anyone, regardless of background or circumstance. The
          web app encourages people to seek help for depression by offering easy-to-use tools
          like a "Hope Box," making mental health care approachable and manageable.</p>
        <p>This website serves as the culminating group project for theStudio Full Stack
          Developer course. Given the challenge to build a Single Page Application (SPA)
          inspired by a famous AI, it was collaboratively brought to life by the authors 
        </p>Vera Costa, José Penacho, Kévin Mateus and Vasco Villas.</p>
