Our project is an SPA (Single Page Application) that offers a relaxing experience with the iconic AI from 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' movie.

This project aims to take a mindful approach to mental health, with the page serving as a "Hope Box," a tool often used in depression treatments.

Feel free to chill with our, once gloomy, but now friendly AI and explore its APIs."

# Languages and technologies

Music Player: Initially the idea was to use Spotify's API, but to be able to request the music we needed, there was the need to create a server to upload the music files. (all licenses purchased)
